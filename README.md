# Detailed analysis report 

To view the main html home page with links to the analysis reports:

- Go to [this page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ni-Ar/SUZ12_AS/blob/main/_Code/index.html) (available only when this GitHub repo will be public)

Explanation: this repository is **private**, for security reason each file has a `token=<TOKEN>` long random word at the end of the URL, that changes from time to time, so it's not possible to create a permanent link for the html preview.

For now to check the individual html report you need to construct the URL with the token manually.

For example for figure 1 you have to:

1. Go to Figure 1 html page ([_Code/Fig1/Main_Panels_Fig1.html](_Code/Fig1/Main_Panels_Fig1.html)) 
2. Click on 'Raw' on the right handside
3. Copy the URL of this "raw" web-page
4. In a new browser tab type `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` and paste the URL you copied in step 4.
