# Detailed analysis report 

To view the html analysis report in `R`:

1. Go to [this page](https://github.com/Ni-Ar/SUZ12_AS/blob/main/_Code/index.html) 
2. Click on 'Raw' on the right handside
3. Copy the URL of this "raw" web-page
4. In a new browser tab type `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` and paste the URL you copied in step 4.

Explanation: this repository is **private**, for security reason each file has a `token=<TOKEN>` long random word at the end of the URL, that changes from time to time, so it's not possible to create a permanent link for the html preview.
